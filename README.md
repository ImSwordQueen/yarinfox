# YaRinFox - Yet Another RinFox fork

## This is only meant for 115 ESR users.

<br>YaRinfox is a semi-continuation/porting/whatever of features that RinFox updated by florin had at some point but were never made into regular RinFox.

This is only a stop gap for me personally until [BeautyFox](https://github.com/dominichayesferen/BeautyFox) gets rewritten with an [Internet Explorer 8 variant](https://github.com/dominichayesferen/BeautyFox/issues/13)
